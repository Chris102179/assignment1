			1.Get prepared. Preheat the oven, check that the sizes of your baking tins are correct and line them with baking paper (a quick rub around the tins with butter before lining will help them stick). Weigh out all of the dry ingredients and measure your liquid amounts. You’ll need a large mixing bowl so you can really mix the batter thoroughly. And check you have electric beaters with the right attachments (if not, a good beat with a manual hand whisk should be okay).<br> 2. Artificial red food colouring is really the only way to get the classic red velvet look. Natural food colourings will not give the same result and in some cases can turn a muddy green. Look out for professional-standard colouring which is stronger so you need less.
			<br>3.If you want perfectly symmetrical cakes,then you should first weigh the batter as a whole before measuring exactly half into each tin. It might seem a bit fussy but that is why those professional cake shop creations look so good.
			<br>4.This is quite a quick bake (25-30 minutes) so don’t wander off and forget about it. Set a timer and check with a skewer at the 25-minute mark. When ready, cooling on a wire rack allows air under the cake so it cools evenly.
			<br>5.Take your soft cheese and butter out the fridge while the cake is cooling, then it should be ready to ice when you are.</p>
